# Exercises
In some of these exercises, you will have to use methods that you have not seen yet. In this case, search on google for an example of use. Take the right habits to avoid being blocked.</br>
**1. Create a variable `age` that contains value 55**</br>
```age = 55```</br>

**2. Adds 10 to variable `age`**</br>
```age += 10```</br>

**3. Create a variable `div_age` and assign it the value of the age divided by 5.**</br>
Note: Be careful, it must be an integer.</br>
```div_age = int(age / 5)```</br>

**4. Create a variable `text_div` that contains the character string `65 divided by 5 is equal 11`.**</br>
note:- You must use the age and div_age variables</br>
```test_div = str(age) + " divided by 5 is equal " + str(div_age)```</br>

**5. Create a variable `rest_div` that contains the rest of the variable `age` divided by 7**</br>
```rest_div = div_age / 7```</br>

**6. Create a variable `exp_div` that contains the value of `rest_div` exponent 3**</br>
```exp_div = rest_div ** 3```</br>

**7. Write a program that enters an integer and then displays the value entered and its type.**</br>
```num = input("Enter a number: ")```</br>
```print(f'The number is {num}, and the type is {type(num)} data type.')```</br>

**8. Use variables to represent the price of materials.**</br>

  * 2 cokes at 2.20€ each

  * 3 Gin & Tonic at 8.60€ each

  * 1 Goat cheese salad at 11.70€

  * 2 steaks with fries at 18€ each

  * 2 spaghetti bolognese at 14.80€ each

**Calculate the sum of all items and store it in a restaurant_bill variable**</br>
**Create a variable `wallet` which has a value of 120 and then create an algorithm that calculates the available money by subtracting the price of the order.**</br>

If there is enough money, record the following sentence in the variable `message` and subtract the expense from `wallet` : - `message` = `You have spent` + `restaurant_bill` + `you have left` + `wallet`

If there is not enough money, record the following sentence in the `message` variable: - message= `Sorry you’re missing amount_missing euros`

If there is 0 left, record the following sentence in the `message` variable: - message = `You are broke!`.</br>
`coke = 2.20 * 2`</br>
```gin_and_tonic = 8.60 * 3```</br>
```goat_cheese_salad = 11.70 * 1```</br>
```steak_with_fries = 18 * 2```</br>
```spaghetti_bolognese = 14.80 * 2```</br>
```restaurant_bill = coke + gin_and_tonic + goat_cheese_salad + steak_with_fries + spaghetti_bolognese```</br>
```
wallet = 120
available = wallet - restaurant_bill
if wallet == 0:
    print('You are broke!')
elif available > 0:
    print(f"You have spent {restaurant_bill}.")
elif available < 0:
    available *= -1
    print(f"Sorry you are missing {available} euros.")
```

** 9. Write a program that asks you to enter 2 values and displays the highest of the 2 values.**</br>
```
input_num = input('Type here numbers separated by comma: ').split(',')
convert_to_list = list(input_num)
results = list(map(int, convert_to_list))
print(max(results))
```
