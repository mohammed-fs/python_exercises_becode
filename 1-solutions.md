**1. Create a variable `age` that contains value 55**</br>
```age = 55```</br>

**2. Adds 10 to variable `age`**</br>
```age += 10```</br>

**3. Create a variable `div_age` and assign it the value of the age divided by 5.**</br>
Note: Be careful, it must be an integer.</br>
```div_age = int(age / 5)```</br>

**4. Create a variable `text_div` that contains the character string `65 divided by 5 is equal 11`.**</br>
note:- You must use the age and div_age variables</br>
```test_div = str(age) + " divided by 5 is equal " + str(div_age)```</br>

**5. Create a variable `rest_div` that contains the rest of the variable `age` divided by 7**</br>
```rest_div = div_age / 7```</br>

**6. Create a variable `exp_div` that contains the value of `rest_div` exponent 3**</br>
```exp_div = rest_div ** 3```</br>

**7. Write a program that enters an integer and then displays the value entered and its type.**</br>
```num = input("Enter a number: ")```</br>
```print(f'The number is {num}, and the type is {type(num)} data type.')```</br>
